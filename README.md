## Starter project with Spring boot.

This is my take on https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start

## How to run the project.
    - I use jdk 11 to run the project. (use sdkman.io to get it).  
    - Clone the repo.
    - Then using IntelliJ open the project ( where the pom file is).
    
    - Enable auto-import.
    - Wait a while
    - Then navigate to the tests (BookIntegrationTest) and try to run them :) 
    
    - If you have any problems or questions - ask me :)
